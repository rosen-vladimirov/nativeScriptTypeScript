Sample project for testing decorators in NativeScript application

The application is using TypeScript decorators. 
In order to make it work, the "experimentalDecorators" flag must be passed to TypeScript compiler. 
Click on the button in the home page and you should see message that contains "decorator" word below it. In case decorators are not working, the message will not have decorator word.
